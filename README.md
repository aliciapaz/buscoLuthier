# Capstone project 1: HTML5 / CSS3 

## Busco Luthier: a directory of luthiers in Santiago, Chile

Capstone project at the end of the first module of Microverse.
This website is based on an online directory of schools, but with the personalised content of luthiers (a person who builds and repairs musical instruments). Using industry tools, I build a site that is composed of 3 pages: a homepage, a search results page and the luthier information page. The platform is fully responsive to all devices: mobile phones, tablets and large screens.
